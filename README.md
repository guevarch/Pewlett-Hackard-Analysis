  - We can see from the image above illustrate that the overwhelming majority of staff are born between 1952 to 1963.
  - There would need to be about the same amount of 72,458 employees hired over a span of time to ensure that there would be enough roles to fill senior engineers,           senior staff, engineers, staff, technqiue leaders, assistant engineers and managers. If they do not hit this hiring rate or promotion rate, there will be a large       impact on the level of expertise, experience and leadership on the company.
  - Since there are only 1940 qualified mentorship eligibility, there are not enough retirement ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of           Pewlett Hackard employees
